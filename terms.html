    <div class="space-y-2 text-gray-700">
      <p>"<strong>Content</strong>" means any data you or your participants upload or create (initials, names, notes, course titles, etc.). You retain ownership, but you grant Herely a worldwide, royalty‑free licence to store, process, analyse (including in anonymised or aggregated form), and display that Content solely to operate and improve the Service.</p>
      <p>You represent that you have all necessary rights and that Content does not violate any law or third‑party rights.</p>
      <p><strong>Copyright & DMCA.</strong> If you believe Content infringes your copyright, send a notice to <a class="text-primary hover:text-blue-800 underline" href="mailto:support@herely.io">support@herely.io</a>. We may remove allegedly infringing material and terminate repeat infringers.</p>

  <section class="space-y-3">
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary">5. Initials</h2>
    <div class="space-y-2 text-gray-700">
      <p>As part of the Service, participants may be asked to provide typed initials, names, or other identifying marks for the purpose of recording attendance. These inputs are stored as part of the course record.</p>
      <p>Herely does not verify the legal identity of signers and does not certify these marks as legally binding electronic signatures under applicable law (such as the ESIGN Act or UETA). They are intended solely as a lightweight attendance signal, not for consent to legal agreements or transactions.</p>
      <p>You agree not to knowingly submit false attendance information. Instructors are responsible for reviewing and verifying attendance data as appropriate for their use case.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary">6. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <div class="space-y-2 text-gray-700">
      <p>You agree not to:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-5 space-y-2">
        <li>Violate any applicable law or infringe intellectual‑property rights;</li>
        <li>Interfere with, disrupt, or attempt to gain unauthorised access to the Service or other accounts;</li>
        <li>Upload malicious code, reverse‑engineer, or resell the Service;</li>
        <li>Use automated scripts or bots to create courses or simulate attendance;</li>

        <li>Use the service to engage in hate speech or harass other users.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A "course" or "program" is a set of sessions with a stable roster. Licences apply per course/program. Excessive roster churn may be deemed abuse and may result in account suspension or course termination.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary">7. Service Management & Storage Limits</h2>
    <div class="space-y-2 text-gray-700">

    <div class="space-y-2 text-gray-700">
      <p>If you are a U.S. educational institution, you remain the custodian of student education records under FERPA.

      <p>Herely takes steps to protect student and participant data — data is encrypted at rest and in transit.</p>

    <div class="space-y-2 text-gray-700">
      <p>These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, USA, without regard to conflict-of-law principles.</p>
    
      <p><strong>BINDING ARBITRATION & CLASS‑ACTION WAIVER.</strong> Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to the Service, these Terms, or any breach thereof, shall be resolved by final and binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules.

      <p>Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
