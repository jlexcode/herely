  <!-- 3 License & IP -->
  <section class="space-y-2">
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary">3. Licence & Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>We grant you a limited, non‑exclusive, non‑transferable right to use the Service for classroom, training, or organizational attendance tracking in accordance with these Terms.</p>
    <p>Herely, its logos, and all related marks are our trademarks. We retain all rights not expressly granted.</p>
    <p><strong>Feedback.</strong> If you choose to give us comments, suggestions, or ideas about the Service ("<em>Feedback</em>"), you grant Herely a perpetual, irrevocable, royalty‑free and transferable licence to use, modify, and incorporate that Feedback without obligation to you.</p>
    <p><strong>U.S. Government rights.</strong> The Service and Documentation are "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation" under FAR 12.212 and DFARS 227.7202; all U.S. Government end‑users acquire them with only those rights set forth in these Terms.</p>
    <p><strong>Export compliance.</strong> You represent that you are not located in, and will not export the Service to, any country subject to U.S. embargo or sanctions and are not on any U.S. Government restricted‑party list.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- 4 UGC -->
  <section class="space-y-2">
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary">4. User‑Generated Content</h2>
    <p>"<strong>Content</strong>" means any data you or your participants upload or create (initials, names, notes, course titles, etc.). You retain ownership, but you grant Herely a worldwide, royalty‑free licence to store, process, analyse (including in anonymised or aggregated form), and display that Content solely to operate and improve the Service.</p>
    <p>You represent that you have all necessary rights and that Content does not violate any law or third‑party rights.</p>
    <p><strong>Copyright & DMCA.</strong> If you believe Content infringes your copyright, send a notice to <a class="text-primary hover:underline" href="mailto:support@herely.io">support@herely.io</a>. We may remove allegedly infringing material and terminate repeat infringers.</p>
  </section>

<!-- 5. Initials -->
<section class="space-y-2">
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary">5.Initials</h2>
    <p>As part of the Service, participants may be asked to provide typed initials, names, or other identifying marks for the purpose of recording attendance. These inputs are stored as part of the course record.</p>
    <p>Herely does not verify the legal identity of signers and does not certify these marks as legally binding electronic signatures under applicable law (such as the ESIGN Act or UETA). They are intended solely as a lightweight attendance signal, not for consent to legal agreements or transactions.</p>
    <p>You agree not to knowingly submit false attendance information. Instructors are responsible for reviewing and verifying attendance data as appropriate for their use case.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- 6 Acceptable Use -->
  <section class="space-y-2">
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary">6. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1">
      <li>Violate any applicable law or infringe intellectual‑property rights;</li>
      <li>Interfere with, disrupt, or attempt to gain unauthorised access to the Service or other accounts;</li>
      <li>Upload malicious code, reverse‑engineer, or resell the Service;</li>
      <li>Use automated scripts or bots to create courses or simulate attendance;</li>
      <li>Harvest, disclose, or use participant data for purposes other than attendance tracking.</li>
      <li>Use the service to engage in hate speech or harass other users.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A "course" or "program" is a set of sessions with a stable roster. Licences apply per course/program. Excessive roster churn may be deemed abuse and may result in account suspension or course termination.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- 7 Site / service management -->
  <section class="space-y-2">
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary">7. Service Management & Storage Limits</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right (but have no obligation) to monitor the Service, investigate misuse, disable or remove Content at our discretion, and to impose reasonable data‑storage or bandwidth limits.  We may rate‑limit or suspend accounts that threaten Service stability or security.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- 8 FERPA -->
  <section class="space-y-2">
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary">8. FERPA, COPPA & Student Data</h2>
    <p>If you are a U.S. educational institution, you remain the custodian of student education records under FERPA. Herely acts as a "school official" with "legitimate educational interest" and processes data solely to provide the Service (<a href="/privacy.html#ferpa" class="text-primary hover:underline">Privacy Policy § 9</a>).</p>
    <p>Herely takes steps to protect student and participant data &mdash; data is encrypted at rest and in transit.</p>
    <p>If participants are under 13, you certify that you have obtained verifiable parental consent or rely on a FERPA exception, complying with COPPA.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- 9 Security & Retention -->
  <section class="space-y-2">
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary">9. Security, Retention & Back‑ups</h2>
    <p>Herely implements commercially reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect Content.  Courses auto‑delete six months after creation, after which related records are irretrievably purged within 30 days.  You acknowledge that no system is perfectly secure and agree to maintain your own back‑ups of critical data.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- 10 Third‑party -->
  <section class="space-y-2">
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary">10. Third‑Party Services</h2>
    <p>The Service relies on third‑party providers (e.g., AWS, Stripe). Their separate terms and privacy policies apply to their services; Herely is not responsible for their acts or omissions.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- 11 Termination -->
  <section class="space-y-2">
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary">11. Termination</h2>

    <p>In no event will we be liable for: (i) lost revenues, profits, data, or goodwill; (ii) indirect, special, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages; or (iii) corruption or loss of Content or backups.</p>

<section class="space-y-2">
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary">16. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, USA, without regard to conflict-of-law principles.</p>
  
    <p><strong>BINDING ARBITRATION & CLASS‑ACTION WAIVER.</strong> Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to the Service, these Terms, or any breach thereof, shall be resolved by final and binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules.

    <p>Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitration will be conducted on an individual basis, and not in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding. YOU AND HERELY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND TO PARTICIPATE IN CLASS ACTIONS. Herely will pay any AAA filing fee above USD $200.</p>
  
    <p><strong>Time Limit to Bring Claims:</strong> Any claim arising out of or related to the Service must be filed within one (1) year after the cause of action arises; otherwise, such claim is permanently barred.</p>
